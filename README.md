MRV Connect: A Streamlined MRV Solution for Agroforestry
Project Overview
MRV Connect is a proof-of-concept prototype designed to simplify and democratize the Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) process for small-scale agroforestry and carbon offset projects. It addresses the significant barrier that complex and manual data collection presents to smallholder farmers and non-profits, enabling more widespread and efficient participation in the carbon market.

The core of this application is a lightweight, single-page web application that uses Google's powerful APIs to create an intuitive user experience.

Key Features
Mobile-First Data Entry: A simple, responsive interface allows users to easily log key metrics like tree counts and crop yields directly from their mobile devices.

AI-Powered Analysis: The application integrates the Gemini API to provide automated, real-time analysis of the data. This means users don't need a technical background to understand their project's progress and carbon impact.

Secure & Real-Time Data Storage: All data is securely stored in a Firebase Firestore database, ensuring that it is tamper-proof and accessible to all authorized stakeholders.

Real-Time Communication: A built-in chat system, powered by Firebase, allows for instant communication between project managers and field agents, improving collaboration and problem-solving.

Decentralized Verification: The platform's transparent data model enables efficient third-party verification, building trust and integrity in the carbon credits generated.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (all contained within a single index.html file for simplicity and portability)

Backend & Database: Google Firebase (Firestore and Authentication)

AI Integration: Google Gemini API for real-time data analysis and insights

Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to set up a Google Firebase project and enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

Clone the repository:

git clone [your-repository-url]

Set up Firebase:

Create a new project in the Firebase Console.

Enable Firestore Database.

Enable Authentication and choose Anonymous sign-in for initial testing.

Configure the app:

In the Firebase Console, go to Project Settings > General and find your Firebase configuration object.

Copy this object and replace the firebaseConfig placeholder in the index.html file.

Set the app_id in the index.html file to your Firebase project's app ID.

Run the application:

Open the index.html file in your web browser. The app will automatically initialize and you can begin testing the features.
